## RESERVOIR RESEARCH

A collection of repositories for the analysis of reservoirs.

Currently, we share the source code for two packages:
1. **geocaret** is a tool for automatic delineation of reservoirs and catchments.
2. **reemission** is a software for calculating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from reservoirs. It relies on the data characterising the reservoir and the cactchment which can be obtained manually or derived using `geocaret`.
